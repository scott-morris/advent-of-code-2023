# Advent of Code 2023

My solutions for [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023)!

Last year, I did my solutions with Native Typescript. I initially wanted to use [bun](https://bun.sh) but at that time, it didn't have access to the file system and the unit testing library was not mature enough to use.

But we're in luck! They've since gotten their ducks in a row and I'm going to try it this year! It will be interesting to see the differences between [deno](https://deno.land/) and [bun](https://bun.sh) in terms of developer experience and QoL issues. (Granted, I'm compairing 2023 Bun vs 2022 Deno, but what can you do?)

- Native TypeScript Support (no transpiling)
- Fast Execution
- Low Overhead

My goal is to have each solution fully tested and fully typed.

## Getting Started

```sh
git clone git@github.com:scott-morris/advent-of-code-2023.git
```

## Downloading your inputs

```sh
TBD
```

## Running a challenge

```sh
bun ./src/day##/index.ts
```

## Running the tests

```sh
cd src
bun test
```

## Using the template

```sh
TBD
```
